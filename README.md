A fun typing challenge that tracks your speed and accuracy. 

I've had this project on my mind for too long. It's a great example of how jQuery can be 
used as a 'getter' and a 'setter'. This is similar to Backbone.js. Also it became evident 
that Backbone.js is inevitable when designing apps, that exceed a certain length of code and 
feature sets. Once things became large enough it was obvious that Backbone.js could easily
solve many of the accumulating problems of scaling.

I developed a rich understanding of events logic and how they intermingle with DOM manipulation.
For example every key stroke is determinate of a new segment of the typed text to display. 

Using the graphing and data capturing for each typing round was a great exorcise in sequencing
triggered events using visualization and custom calculated scores. Working
on the one offs and designing a more modular design pattern was fun. Enjoy!
