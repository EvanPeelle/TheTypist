LEARNED:
when using blocks they are not sensitive to spacing in the dom.
when using span they are sensitive to spacing known as 'inline'.
Think in isolated problems:
Think in terms of scoping and resources for each scoped issue.
Keep an even keel for intake and output of coding execution/research.
commit frequently.
hold off on color for as long as possible because it is deceptive and gets in the way of the development.
colors delicately used can be helpful
looking into library how the images are formed(in vector or other)



OTHER:
big key images that fade out after enlarging on the page.
